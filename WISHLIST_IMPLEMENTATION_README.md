## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CSRF Token Errors**: Ensure `<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">` is in the layout
2. **Authentication Errors**: Verify user is logged in and session is active
3. **Database Errors**: Ensure migration has been run successfully
4. **JavaScript Errors**: Check browser console for any script errors

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check migration status
php artisan migrate:status

# Clear application cache
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Check routes
php artisan route:list | grep wishlist
```

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready wishlist feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing Laravel e-commerce application while maintaining all existing functionality and design patterns.
